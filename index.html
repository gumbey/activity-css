    <h2>What is Android?</h2>
    <p><strong>Android</strong> is an operating system based on the <em>Linux kernel</em>, and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Initially developed by <strong>Android</strong>, Inc., which <em>Google</em> backed financially and later bought in 2005, <strong>Android</strong> was unveiled in 2007 along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance: a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. The first publicly available smartphone running <strong>Android</strong>, the <em>HTC Dream</em>, was released on October 22, 2008.</p>

    <h2>Heres a bit of history.</h2>
    
    <p><em>Google</em> acquired <strong>Android Inc.</strong> on August 17, 2005; key employees of <strong>Android Inc.</strong>, including Rubin, Miner and White, stayed at the company after the acquisition. Not much was known about <strong>Android Inc</strong>. at the time, but many assumed that <em>Google</em> was planning to enter the mobile phone market with this move. At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the <em>Linux kernel</em>. <em>Google</em> marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradable system. <em>Google</em> had lined up a series of hardware component and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation on their part.</p>
    
    <h2>How does this make Android Better then Apple?</h2>
    
    <p>A new report from <em>Kantar Worldpanel ComTech</em> says that <strong>Android</strong> devices as a group outsold the <em>iPhone</em> in the U.S. during the three months ending January 2013, with their share of total sales rising to nearly 50%. <img src="images/galaxy.png">The report, based on the results of Kantar's ongoing consumer panel research, saw U.S. <strong>Android</strong> sales rise a little more than 6% compared to the same period one year ago, while iOS lost just less than 5%, finishing at about 46%. Sprint customers were particularly likely to buy <strong>Android</strong> devices during the studied time frame, according to the study - to the tune of 72% of all smartphone sales.</p>
    
    <h2>The last reason why <strong>Android</strong> is better then Apple IOS.</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Android</strong> has an active community of developers and enthusiasts who use the <em>Android Open Source Project</em> source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system. These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, albeit without as extensive testing or quality assurance; provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates; or bring <strong>Android</strong> to devices that were officially released running other operating systems, such as the <em>HP TouchPad</em>. Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications unsuitable for non-technical users, such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device's processor. <em>CyanogenMod</em> is the most widely used community firmware, and acts as a foundation for numerous others.</p>
